# monitoar <small class="text-muted">An app for supporting open access monitoring</small>

<!--There is an increasing need to report spending for open access publication fees, and to compare these expenditure across institutions, journals or publishers. A [recent study shows](https://peerj.com/articles/2323/) that the DOI minting agency [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) thoroughly covers open access journal articles where academic institutions sponsored a publication fee. -->

The aim of this app is to help researchers, research administrators and librarians who are in charge of reporting open access publication fee spending to prepare a standardized data spreadsheet in accordance with the [Open APC metadata schema](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/wiki/sources_api).

<!-- **Please note that this app is in early development!** -->

<!-- which - contains disambiguate metadata from [Crossref](http://search.crossref.org/),   - includes information about the article's indexing status in [Europe PubMed Central](https://europepmc.org/), if the journal is listed in the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/) - and if the [Open APC initiative](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/) already discloses spending information about the article. The data spreadsheet is is in accordance with the [Open APC metadata schema](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/wiki/sources_api). -->

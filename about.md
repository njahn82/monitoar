There is an increasing need to report spending for open access publication fees, and to compare these expenditure across institutions, journals or publishers. A [recent study shows](https://peerj.com/articles/2323/) that the DOI minting agency [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) thoroughly covers open access journal articles where academic institutions sponsored a publication fee. 

The aim of this app is to help librarians who are in charge of reporting open access publication fee spending to prepare a standardized data spreadsheet, which contains disambiguate metadata from Crossref, and which is in accordance with the [Open APC metadata schema](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/wiki/sources_api).

**Please note that this app is in early development!**
